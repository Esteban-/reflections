When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	I would make a remote repository for projects that I would want to share or collaborative projects.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	I might want to always to pull changes manually so I can keep track of what changes are going on.
	If git did this automatically, espcially on collaborative projects, I would get somewhat lost.
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	A fork is a copy of repository on github saved in github, used to make commit to repositories you don't have acess.
	A clone is a copy of a repository on github saved locally, used to make changes offline.
	A branch is creating variation of the current master branch, used to make experimental changes without affecting the stable master branch.
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	The benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally is that helps in the process of merging the master and origin branch.
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	I would have to make local copies of the files and set dates for meetings/discussions to get all the members on the same page.
	It would be easier to start for members that don't know how to use github, however, when it comes to bugs and solve conflicts, it would be much more difficult to manage.
